    "# Extra Credit Opportuinity\n",
    "\n",
    "# Can You Predit a 20 Day Change in Stock Price?\n",
    "* Get 5 points added to your lowest Major Lab grade (Lab 1, 2, or 3) for completing the extra credit. \n",
    "* Get 10 additional points, if you achieve a lower Mean Absolute Error < 25% OR a Correct direction > 57.6%\n",
    "\n",
    "# Instructions \n",
    "1. Create and execute three original 30 day simulation models (Examples below) trying to improve your MAE each time. \n",
    "2. Pickel your predictions for each run using the .gz file extension and the file names shown below. \n",
    "3. Execute the code in the observations section using the predictions from your best run. \n",
    "4. Update with your own observations. Feel free to add any visuals or tables you need to support your observations.\n",
    "5. State how many Extra Credit points you think you should be awarded.  If you qualify for the 10 additional points, explain how / why you think your model achieves a better result. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Rules\n",
    "* All extra credit work and submissions must be individual.  Do not share your approaches.    \n",
    "* \"Original\" simualtions include you making changes to the models, parameter tuning, feature selection, feature engineering, training record selection strategies etc. to achieve a better result. \n",
    "* Feel free to run more than three simulations, but only include your best 3 simulations in the final submission. \n",
    "* You MUST use the make_cv_folds() function and the train / test folds it creates for the simulation.  DO NOT modify this code in any way.\n",
    "* You MUST use the example code below to execute your simulations.  \n",
    "* Only modify the simuilation code to improve the model predictions.   \n",
    "* You must make a prediction for each of the 30 days and 2,065 test records as shown below.\n",
    "* You must train your model using some or all of the training data for each respective fold (see examples below).\n",
    "* DO NOT mix folds in any way. Use the simulation examples as a starting point. Training records for each fold are 20 days older than the test records you are trying to predict. \n",
    "* DO NOT add new or future training data to the folds!!! \n",
    "* Simulation predictions must be pickled/saved using the filenames: pred_data_e1.gz, pred_data_e2.gz, and pred_data_e3.gz as shown below.\n",
    "* Your work MUST be reproduceable! I will not award any points if I cannot reproduce your work using the cv_folds below!   \n",
    "* You may use any scikit learn tools to create better predictions.\n",
    "* I WILL MAKE A FINAL DETERMINATION ON AWARDING EXTRA CREDIT POINTS. PLEASE ASK IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, DO NOT ASSUME.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Things to Consider Trying\n",
    "* Modify TfidfVectorizer() parameters to make better features. \n",
    "* Use different models or model ensembles.\n",
    "* Use sklearn.feature_selection (SelectFromModel, SelectKBest) to select better features.\n",
    "* Try out the AdaBoostRegressor()\n",
    "* Try dimensionality reduction or remove very rare features from the TfidfVectorizer's sparse matrix.  "
